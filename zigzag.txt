Python follows BODMAS

Variables must have meaningful names

An expression is a combination of an operator and operations that evaluate to a value, e.g.

6
6+5
(3 * 23) + 20
a>b

ASSIGNMENT STATEMENT is where a value of an expression is stored in a variable.

#Integer operations:
#Addition
x + y

#Subtraction
x-y

Multiplcation
x*y

Division
x/y

Integer division - returns an integer only
x//y

Modulo - Remainder of x/y
x % y 

Negate - negative value 
-x 

Absolute zero - Absolute value or magnitude of x
abs(x)

Cast - converts to an integer
int(x)

Power - x raised to the power of y
pow(x,y)
or
x**y


Functions

Functions are blocks of code that perform specific functions allowing to reuse these as many times as you want through your program.
They can have no inputs or multiple inputs and no outputs or multiple outputs.
Functions return a value. 
ARGUMENTS are the actual values that are 
supplied during a function call. may or may not return a value.


Parameter
Parameters are the placeholders that are used in defining a function. 
ARGUMENTS are the actual values that are 
supplied during a function call. may or may not return a value.


sum(a,b) a and b are the parameters.
sum(4,5) 4 and 5 are the arguments.
